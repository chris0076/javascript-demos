                        This is just a basic demo of Voronoi (worley noise).

                        Clicking the canvas will rerender with a new set of random points. Pressing <code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>D</code>, or <code>F</code> will change the distance metric used to euclidean squared, euclidean, manhattan, or chebychev, respectively.

                        This demo is the same as the one before with the added ability to click to add points to calculate the image from. The algorthm used is extremely naive (n^2 comparisons), and is not suitable for much more than a couple points. The comparisons could be reduced by using Fortune's algorthm.

                        This is a mandelbrot.
                        <p>
                        Left clicking will zoom in on that point, right clicking will zoom out. Note: Around a zoom level of 45 you will notice the limits of the precision of javascript's floats. This causes pixellation and banding in the image.

                        As you scrub from left to right it adds more iterations (1 iteration per 4 pixels). With this you can see the added detail with running more iterations.

                        This is the same as before with an added smoothing function for the coloring.
                        <p>
                        Scrubbing from left to right scales the amount before the smoothing repeats.

                        When the line is red, it means that the point is inside the Mandelbrot Set. If it is green, then it is not.

                        The following three canvases are demos of what is called the buddhabrot (the name comes from the fact that it looks like an image of Buddha rotated 90 degrees). This method of rendering the mandelbrot set makes use of the effect seen in the previous demo. Rather than just rendering how long it takes for the path to escape from the mandelbrot set it makes a 2D histogram of the points as they are escaping. The points are sampled over the image via the Monte Carlo method. Possible improvements can be done with Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
                        <p>
                        As you mouseover them they will begin calculating in the background. Upon clicking they will render the current values.

                        </div>
                        The following is the result if the images above are added together with each one going to a different color channel. This method of rendering the mandelbrot set is called the nebulabrot (due to the fact that the coloring scheme is similar to the method that is used when taking pictures of nebulas). Note: for this to work properly you must have ran the previous three canvases.
                        <p>
                        Pressing <code>A</code> will cycle the color channels r -> g -> b.
                        Pressing <code>S</code> will flip the red and green channels.
